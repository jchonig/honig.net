- Title: Clarkson University / Educational Resources Center

    After attending [Clarkson University](http://www.clarkson.edu) for two years I worked for the Educational Resources Center (formerly the Computing Center) installing and supporting systems, communications and networking, even overseeing connection to the fledgling Internet.

- Title: Cornell University Theory Center
  Description: >
    I moved to the [Cornell University Theory Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University_Center_for_Advanced_Computing) in 1987 as chief developer on the Gated project. In addition I provided support of the phase I NSFnet project. Since the [Merit](https://www.merit.edu/)-run NSFnet took over I focused mostly on Gated. In 1991 the Gated project moved to the Advanced Technologies and Planning group of the Network Resources division of Cornell Information Technologies in support of the campus backbone and I followed. In 1995 CIT realized that the Gated project could be managed better elsewhere and transferred it to Merit.

- Title: Berkeley Software Design, Inc.
  Description: >
    I joined [Berkeley Software Design, Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Design) as a Member of Technical Staff shortly after the Gated project left Cornell. There I worked on quite a number of different projects including re-writing system daemons, integrating external software, debugging the BSD kernel, integrating the HARP ATM stack.

- Title: Wind River Systems, Inc.
  Description: >
    I joined [Wind River Systems,Inc.](https://www.windriver.com/) as part of an acquisition of the BSD/OS and FreeBSD groups of Berkeley Software Design in May of 2001. BSD/OS stayed around for a few years; eventually Wind River realized they didn't know how to sell and market it. I took a short break managing VxWorks filesystems and then moved on to the fledgling Linux team, moving from managing BSP development to build system, toolchain and development infrastructure and eventually being in charge of day-to-day operations for Wind River Linux development. During that time I learned about Agile, ISO 9001, Continuous Integration, Configuration Management among other things. I still managed to keep my hands dirty, writing high level designs and even doing a bit of Yocto Project integration and bug fixing. Eventually Wind River started cutting remote employees and we parted ways in June of 2016.

    In May of 2017 I joined [AppNexus, Inc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppNexus) as a Senior Systems Architect supporting disagregated storage in our private cloud. Configuration Management with puppet and scripting with python and REST APIs were supplemented by a central SQL configuration database. In 2018 AT&T acquired AppNexus and merged it with AdCo to form [Xandr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xandr).

  Description: >
    In December 2021, [Microsoft](www.microsoft.com) announced its intention to acquire Xandr from AT&T. This acquisition was completed in June of 2022. At the end of June, 2025 I retired from Microsoft.
