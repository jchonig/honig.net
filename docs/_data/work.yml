- Title: My Career in Computing
  Description: |
    I've done a variety of different things with computers and people
    during my career and developed the technical and leadership skills
    to identify and overcome technical and operational
    obstacles. Working on system administration, software and OS
    development as a developer and as management has given me a broader
    perspective and the ability to understand the position of other
    teams.

    While most of my work in recent years has been remote I don't work
    in isolation. I thrive on working with people at various levels
    and encourage each individual and team to contribute their best
    work toward a common goal.

    I started my career doing Systems Programming on an [IBM
    360/65](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/IBM_System/360_Model_65)
    at Clarkson College (now [Clarkson
    University](http://www.clarkson.edu)) in Potsdam, NY. Systems
    programming was what we called ystem administration those
    days. Instead of cool tools like Perl, Python and PowerShell, we
    had IBM 360 Assembly Language. Computers took up large rooms, and
    computing was done by submitting batch jobs (decks of punched
    cards) to the OS/MVT operating system and looking at the resulting
    printouts a while later. Definitely not environmentally friendly.

    Time Sharing computing was the buzzword of the day. That's where a
    mainframe would support many interactive users editing jobs to
    submit. This was done with the
    [ROSCOE](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Applied_Data_Research)
    system, which was really just another batch job that never
    finished. It controlled a lab full of
    [ADM-3A](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/ADM-3A)
    terminals, most of which were not equipped with lowercase
    chips. BACK THEN ALL CAPS WAS THE NORM AND WASN'T CONSIDERED
    SHOUTING.

    #### Educational Resources Center

    After I was at at Clarkson for a few years they built a new
    building combining information technologies, the library, media
    production and computing center into a new building on the hill
    campus called the Educational Resources Center. One of the goals
    was to bring innovative computing to the University.

    As part of this move research was required into a new computing
    platform. The major contenders were the [IBM
    4341](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/IBM_4300%23/IBM_4341)
    and a [UNIVAC
    1100](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/UNIVAC_1100/2200_series%23/1110)
    series. The IBM 4341 won out, primarily because of the legacy
    administrative computing systems dependent on IBM software. In the
    long run this was a better decision, the IBM computing platform
    was supported for much longer than the UNIVAC.

    The IBM 4341 supported virtual machines and ran VM/370, basically
    a hypervisor like today's VMWare ESX. Under that we ran OS/VS1 to
    continue to process legacy batch jobs and provided more
    interactive computing via the [McGill University System for
    Interactive Computing](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/MUSIC/SP) (MUSIC)
    a timesharing system written in FORTRAN and designed to run under
    VM/370.

    My challenge was to get the basic VM/370 running and port our
    modifications to OS/MVT onto the newer OS/VS1 so that our
    administrative computing group to keep the college running. I
    spent many weeks alone in the new building to get the system
    running in time.

    #### System Architecting

    As my career at Clarkson progressed I became more involved in
    architecting solutions to computing challenges at the
    University. Some of these included:

    ##### Academic Computing

    ![VAX 11/780](images/VAX11_780.jpg){: width="75%" height="auto"}

    The engineering departments were not thrilled with the computing
    services on the mainframe. This is understandable as IBM's main
    focus was business computing. I was part of a small team
    researching the options of a DEC VAX 11/780 or a Perkin Elmer
    computing system. The end result was the VAX 11/780 which, like
    the IBM, had better longevity.

    ##### Telecommunications Infrastructure

    With the move of the computing center came the challenge of
    telecommunications and networking. The administrative computing
    group and most of the administrative offices which were the main
    users of the computing facilities were downtown and the computing
    resources they required were a mile away on the hill campus. These
    were the days before the adoption of the Internet so the options
    were limited.

    Our solution was a dedicated cable link leased from the local
    cable company. On this link we were able to run 64k Baud
    synchronous lines and 19.2K Baud async lines. The 64K Baud sync
    lines worked fine for remote job entry (card readers and printers)
    and some expensive and proprietary IBM 3270 class terminals. The
    19.2K async lines were not cost effective for remote terminal
    access though.

    The solution we designed was an X.25 network that aggregated ASCII
    terminal connections onto the 64k Baud synchronous channels. This
    allowed the proliferation of ASCII terminals throughout campus at
    a lower cost.

    I designed a physical telecommunications infrastructure that made
    it easy to maintain and debug all those synchronous and
    asynchronous telecommunications links. We had patch panels that
    allowed us to reroute connections quickly and also plug in to
    monitor them with a protocol analyzer. I spent many hours with
    said protocol analyzer diagnosing communications problems.

    ##### The PC era

    ![Zenith Z-100 (image courtesy of DigiBarn)](images/Zenith_Z100.jpg){: width="75%" height="auto"}

    Clarkson's first foray into the PC was the Zenith Z-100 running
    the
    [Z-DOS](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Z-DOS)
    version of MS-DOS; the school became the first college in the
    nation to distribute machines to every incoming freshman in the
    Fall of 1983. It was very similar to, but slightly different from
    the IBM PC of the era. Everyone wanted one on their desk, however
    they also wanted to connect to the IBM 4341 mainframe and later
    the Gould super-minicomputer and the DEC 11/780.

    My solution was to write a terminal program that allowed folks
    with PCs to connect into both the IBM 4341 mainframe and the new
    supermini-computer. Now folks with PCs could access the big
    computers without requiring a separate ASCII terminal.

    That supermini-computer was my first experience with Unix. It was
    a Gould PowerNode 9080 running the BSD variant of Unix. Also
    making an appearance were the AT&T 3B2s and Sun Workstations.

    ##### The Internet

    Another big thing in the 80s was networking. Clarkson first
    connected to
    [BITNET](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/BITNET),
    an educational network of mostly IBM mainframes. BITNET allowed
    e-mail and mailing lists as well as remote job submission. It even
    had support for instant messaging and functioned as an early
    social network. Our challenge with BITNET was connecting. BITNET
    required new members to buy a telecommunications line to an
    existing member. Because of the telecommunications tariffs it was
    cheaper to get a connection to a site outside of New York, so we
    ended up connecting to the University of Connecticut.

    The next networking challenge was the fledgling Internet. I
    managed two connections to the Internet, one to the MILNET via a
    Mt Xinu BSD Unix system running on a DEC MicroVAX II and the other
    via NYSERnet which connected them to the wider world. Back then it
    was mostly e-mail and remote logins. Data transfer was via email
    and FTP and remote login used unencrypted telnet. This was well
    before the advent of World Wide Web.

    ![DEC MicroVAX II Image courtesy Gunkies](images/MicroVaxIII.jpg){: width="75%" height="auto"}

    Bringing up the Mt Xinu BSD Unix system was a challenge in
    itself. For example, I had ordered disks in sizes that were not
    yet supported by the OS. So during the installation I had to add a
    new entry for the disk size, recompile the kernel, and
    reboot. This went relatively smoothly and was a great learning
    experience for my first foray into Unix.

    In those days of static host tables, before the domain name
    system, we needed tools to manage all the IP address
    assignments. I implemented an IP Address Management (IPAM) tool in
    our NOMAD database that let the operations staff handle requests
    for addresses and removed this responsibility from the programming
    team. This application generated host tables that were made
    available for download in various formats.

- Title: Cornell University
  Description: |
    #### Cornell Theory Center

    ![Image courtesy Wikipedia](images/NSFNet.png){: width="75%" height="auto"}

    My experience with the Internet, Unix and software development
    landed me a job at the Cornell University Theory Center in Ithaca,
    NY to help run phase I of the
    [NFSNET](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/National_Science_Foundation_Network). There
    I became the lead programmer on the Gated project. Gated was an
    Open Source routing daemon used on the Unix hosts that formed the
    NSFNET and by several routing manufacturers.

    When I took over Gated it was a hack to add the NSFNET HELLO
    routing protocol to the existing BSD routing daemon which
    supported only the RIP protocol. I turned it into a framework for
    efficiently implementing and testing routing protocols. When
    Cornell passed the project to [Merit](https:///www.merit.edu),
    Gated had support for RIP, OSPF, EGP, BGP, and Router Discovery.

    During this time I learned some concepts that are still relevant
    today. I worked with a community of contributors to build a better
    project through collaboration. I also implemented a build farm
    with numerous different flavors of Unix and Linux on which I would
    spin up parallel builds to ensure the code changes compiled
    everywhere. I made heavy use of CVS for Source Configuration
    Management. To the chagrin of my management, the concept of
    Project Management was pretty foreign to me.

    I also participated in the [Internet Engineering Task
    Force](https://www.ietf.org) (IETF) on the design of several
    routing protocols, including OSPF and RIP v2. Gated was an
    excellent platform for prototyping new routing protocols and had
    one of the first implementations of the BGP protocol.

    ![Original UNIX license plate](images/UNIX_plate.jpg){: width="75%" height="auto"}

    This was the heyday of the Sun workstation and the beginning of
    BSD Unix and Linux running on PC hardware. In addition to
    extensive knowledge of TCP/IP networking, the protocols that are
    the foundation of the Internet, I learned a lot about BSD Unix,
    especially in the area of packet forwarding and routing tables.

- Title: Berkeley Software Design, Inc
  Description: |
    ![Beastie, the mascot of Berkeley Software Distribution](images/Beastie.jpg){: width="25%" height="auto"}

    When Cornell lost interest in the development of the Gated
    software, I accepted a job at Berkeley Software Design, Inc
    (BSDi). I had interacted with some of the principals at BSDi in my
    work on Gated and at the IETF and was quite interested in getting
    more involved in OS development.

    BSDi sold and supported a commercial derivative of UC Berkeley's
    BSD Unix called BSD/OS. BSD was a derivative of the original AT&T
    Unix as opposed to Linux which is a compatible
    re-implementation. BSD shares much of the same source code with
    the original AT&T Unix and there is much written on the AT&T
    lawsuit against BSDi and UC Berkeley.

    ##### Working remotely

    As a company, BSDi was almost fully distributed, I worked from
    home and rarely met with my co-workers in person, usually at
    technical conferences. That does not mean I was isolated as we
    interacted daily via instant messaging, phone and e-mail.

    Development was distributed as well. We all did our development on
    our local machines and would sync the changes up to the CVS trees
    at the main office. During my time there I worked on many
    different parts of the OS, from low-level interrupt handling
    though fixing and re-writing system utilities, improving the NFS
    and C library thread implementation and implementing locking in
    kernel networking subsystems.

- Title: Wind River Systems, Inc
  Description: |
    BSDi was acquired by [Wind River Systems,
    Inc](https://www.windriver.com), an
    embedded operating systems company whose primary product is
    VxWorks, a real-time OS. Wind River realized that they needed to
    expand their portfolio with a general purpose embedded Operating
    System. The BSD/OS project lived on for a while as the Platform
    for Server Appliances, but failed to gain traction against the
    juggernaut that is Linux.

    ##### Linux

    ![Image courtesy WikiMedia](images/Tux.png){: width="25%" height="auto"}

    Eventually Wind River changed direction and embraced Linux and my
    involvement turned to management. This transition occurred because
    my boss at the time noticed that instead of staying heads-down, I
    would keep in touch with my co-workers, even calling them up on a
    phone to actually talk. This transition was nothing like that in
    the recent [Dilbert story
    arc](https://dilbert.com/strip/2017-02-11).

    ##### Board Support Packages

    One of my first responsibilities on the Wind River Linux team was
    managing ports of Wind River Linux to new boards, this was
    referred to as developing a Board Support Package (BSP). There was
    a lot of miscommunications about what this meant and the
    prerequisites developing a BSP. I worked with my team, Product
    Marketing, Alliances and other teams to come up with a process for
    BSP development that was explicit about prerequisites and
    deliveries. Years later when I had moved on to managing other
    parts of Wind River Linux this process was still in use.

    ##### Agile

    ![Agile](images/Agile.png){: width="75%" height="auto"}

    As an Engineering Manager I learned to dislike the [Waterfall
    model of Project
    Management](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Waterfall_model). The
    up-front planning of the Waterfall model does not adapt well to
    complicated software projects. The Wind River Linux team was one
    of the first to embrace the [Agile model of Project
    Management](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Agile_software_development). I
    helped lead our transition and we managed to apply it quite
    effectively despite having widely distributed teams. When I left
    Wind River I was managing a few Agile teams as well as the roll-up
    of all the Wind River Linux Agile teams.

    ##### ISO 9001

    One of Wind River's major customers requested Linux meet ISO 9001
    specifications. Put simply, ISO 9001 requires you to document what
    you are going to do, document that you have done it, and
    continuously improve your processes. While initially scary, this
    is a good thing and something that Wind River Linux was already
    doing to a large extent. The challenge here was not to add more
    process than was actually needed, ISO 9001 does not need to be
    heavy-weight. I left before we had been fully audited but a
    preliminary audit was successful.

    ##### Technical Chops

    While doing management I kept my technical skills up to date,
    solving technical problems with development and engineering
    operations. During critical times I would jump in to fix bugs. I
    especially enjoyed projects where my technical chops could be
    applied. One way I did this was by building a Linux Infrastructure
    group to efficiently support the Wind River Linux development,
    test and release efforts. Our small team (basically less than one
    full-time person) managed 150 systems in three data centers
    (Beijing China, Oakland California and Ottawa Canada) using Docker
    Containers to do thousands of Wind River Linux builds a day.

    ##### Git-based installation

    A big challenge with Wind River Linux was the installation
    experience. Wind River Linux is a source distribution used to
    create a Linux Distribution to deploy to a customer's board. It is
    similar in size and functionality to the SDK development platforms
    like Android Studio and Apple's Xcode. Wind River's standard
    installation technologies were not designed with the Wind River
    Linux model of hundreds of git trees.

    I led the project to convert Wind River Linux to a git-based
    installation model from a management perspective and also made
    significant technical contributions. This was a complicated
    project which required coordination with several other groups at
    Wind River with different priorities. Our git-based installation
    needed to work seamlessly with the standard Wind River Linux
    Java-based installer as well as stand-alone. We had to work
    closely with the Release Engineering team responsible for the web
    hosting. While frustrating at times I enjoyed working with all
    these groups to overcome the issues and release a solid product.

    ##### Engineering Management

    While spearheading these side projects I was also first-line
    manager for a team of about ten software developers, including two
    architects. I directly managed the development of the Wind River
    Linux build system and system integration as well as the
    integration of the compiler toolchain supplied from outside the
    Wind River Linux group. I also had day-to-day responsibility over
    the half-dozen teams delivering all the components for a major
    Wind River Linux release. This included coordination with Product
    Management, Release Engineering, Export, Intellectual Property,
    Documentation, Installation, IDE development, Customer Support,
    and Field Engineering.

    ##### Leaving Wind River

    Wind River decided to focus more on co-located development in
    Centers of Excellence and slowly let go of most remote folks. My
    turn came in the summer of 2016.

- Title: AppNexus / Xandr / Microsoft
  Description: |
    In May of 2017 I joined [AppNexus, Inc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppNexus) as a Senior Systems Architect supporting disagregated storage in our private cloud. Configuration Management with puppet and scripting with python and REST APIs were supplemented by a central SQL configuration database.

    In 2018 AT&T acquired AppNexus and merged it with AdCo to form
    [Xandr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xandr).

    In December 2021, [Microsoft](www.microsoft.com) announced its intention to acquire Xandr from AT&T. This acquisition was completed in June of 2022.

- Title: Retirement
  Description: |
    At the end of June, 2025 I retired from Microsoft.

- Title: Scobey-Carvell
  Description: |
    While I was not working during the summer of 2016, I formed
    Scobey-Carvell an LLC that I can use for consulting.

    I'm always willing to consider work.
