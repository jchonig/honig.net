- Title: Volvos
  Background: 245GLT.jpg
  Description: |
    My first new car was a 1981 SAAB 900 (903M to be exact).  That was
    a fun car, but NY salt took it's toll.

    When my parents passed we inherited their 1985 Volvo 245 DL which
    we drove for serval years and really enjoyed.  We didn't drive it
    in the winter because that was the year before they started
    galvanizing the body and it would have rusted out quickly.

    After that we were pretty hooked on Volvos and have had quite a
    few:

- Title: FIRST Robotics
  Description: |
    In the summer of 2013 my youngest son expressed interest in
    joining a local [FIRST LEGO League](firstlegoleague.org){:
    .external-link} team.  I tagged along to see what it was about and
    if I could help.  I volunteered to be an assistant coach, but
    ended up being the lead coach for the Bots of the Round Table in
    the Nature's Fury challenge and having a blast.  The next year I
    coached the Hacker Catz in the World Class challenge.  In 2015 I
    was back with the Bots of the Round Table for the Trash Trek
    challenge.  For the Animal Allies challenge I was again with the
    Bots of the Round Table.

    At the end of 2014 I ran into the lead mentor for the Trumansburg
    [FIRST Robotics
    Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/programs/frc){:
    .external-link} team at a party and asked if I could help.  He
    gratefully accepted and I obtained clearance to be an advisor at
    the Trumansburg High School and started coming to the practices
    for the Trumansburg Robot Raiders (FRC 5254) while they prepared
    for the Recycle Rush challenge.  Robots, power tools and
    computers, how could I resist?  It was quite a ride, this second
    year team made it to the finals at the Tech Valley and Finger
    Lakes regionals and was invited to the World Championships in St
    Louis.  The next year the team rebranded as FRC5254: HYPE (Helping
    Youth Persue Excellence) and competed in the FIRST Stronghold
    challenge.  The results were similar, we made it to the finals at
    the Tech Valley regional and won an award, the semi-Finals at the
    Finger Lakes Regional and won an award there too, and made it to
    the semi-finals at the World Championships.  In 2017 the challenge
    will be Steampunk and we are looking forward to what that will
    bring.

    During my first season I was asked to join the board of
    [Trumansburg Robotics, Inc](www.trumansburgrobotics.org){:
    .external-link} a NYS approved Educational charity being created
    to bring the FIRST experience to the Trumansburg, NY area.  As
    secretary I've helped drive the adoption of the by-laws, conflict
    of interest policy and other documentations and obtain 501(c)(3)
    non-profit status.
