- Title: The Things Network
  Background: ttn_bg.jpg
  Description: |
    [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) is a grass
    roots, community driven, effort to provide free access for low
    power, low speed Internet of Things deployment in cities or other
    regions around the world.  My contribution is working with the
    Ithaca, NY and New York City teams to apply Configuration
    Management to our gateways.  My
    [Ansible](https://github.com/IthacaThings/ttn-multitech-cm)
    control repository can do virtually all configuration of the
    [MultiTech](https://www.multitech.net/developer/products/multiconnect-conduit-platform/)
    Conduits including firmware upgrades.

- Title: Puppet, Ansible and Configuration Management
  Background: puppet_bg.jpg
  Description: |
    I'm a software engineer at heart, which means I'm lazy; I don't
    want to do a job more than once.  This applies to system
    administration.  I run a number of Linux (mostly Debian at this
    time) systems and one of my least favorite tasks is making sure I
    have configured something properly on all of them.  And I
    especially hate having to remember everything that I need to
    reconfigure when I install a new system or reconfigure one that
    died.

    While travelling to Beaverton, OR for work once many years ago I
    picked up a copy of Linux Journal and read about Configuration
    Management with Puppet.  When I got home I tried it out and was
    hooked.  My configuration is up to over 9,000 lines of Puppet
    manifests and Hiera configs.

    One place where Puppet will not work well is my Cloud server.  I
    don't want to share all the Puppet configuration and do not want
    to open a VPN back to my home network.  I read an article on
    Ansible and gave that a try.  It's a perfect fit for managing a
    remote server.  I currently use Ansible to configure my Mac
    (similar to Jeff Gerling's
    [mac-dev-playbook](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook)),
    but mine is not public). cloud servers and Raspberry Pis.

- Title: E-Mail
  Background: email_bg.png
  Description: |
    I mainly use Gmail because it has great SPAM filtering and makes
    my mail available on all my devices.  For secure e-mail I use
    [Proton Mail](https://proton.me).

    I have been a heavy user of the [nmh](https://www.nongnu.org/nmh/)
    mail system for decades and a developer on the
    [mh-e](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mh-e/) front-end for nmh
    in Emacs.  For large volumes of mail (i.e. at work), MH-E was much
    more efficient.

    Unfortuneatly employers after Wind River thought security was more
    important than productivity and we were forced into a closed
    ecosystem.

    At home I use postfix configured to send e-mail.  For years I used
    sendmail and wrote custom configurations but I find postfix easier
    to configure.

- Title: Unix/BSD/Linux
  Background: bsd_linux_bg.jpg
  Description: |
    My first exposure to Unix was a BSD port on a Gould PowerNode 9000
    while at Clarkson University.  Back then I was a mainframe guy
    (VM/CMS) and implementing a terminal program on MS-DOS.  Then I
    installed Mt Xinu on a microVax to build an Internet gateway.
    Part of the bring-up was booting into single user mode and adding
    support for the latest disk drives.

    When I moved to the Cornell Theory Center I moved headlong into
    the Unix world, using SunOS (BSD at first and then System V based)
    and eventually became the owner of the infamous
    devvax.tn.cornell.edu (a DEC VAX 11/750 running BSD 4.2 and
    eventually running BSD/OS on an i486).  That was back when you
    built your own copy of gcc, compiling it three times just to be
    sure it worked.  By then my life was totally on Unix/BSD.

    I joined BSDi in 1995 to work as a core engineeri on BSD/OS.
    BSD/OS was a commercial derivative of the BSD/386 port.  I had a
    very enjoyable five years at BSDi working on many different facets
    of the OS.  In 2001 Wind River acquired the rights to BSD/OS and
    hired most of the engineers.  BSD/OS lived on for a few years at
    Wind River as the Platform for Server Appliances.

    After BSD/OS Wind River started Wind River Linux, an embedded
    Linux distribution to complement their VxWorks real-time offering.
    Eventually I converted all my BSD/OS systems to Linux, first
    Fedora and then Ubuntu.  At one point I had half a dozen systems
    running Ubuntu, at the time of this writing it's a couple.  A
    server (Plex, Nextcloud, Gitlab, backups, DNS, DHCP), a low power
    server (running UniFi Controller, M/Monit, DNS, DHCP) and another
    lower power server running at our house in Florida (because, that
    is what you do).

    At AppNexus/Xandr/Microsoft I was part of the architecture team
    for the internal cloud, consisting of more than 13,000 servers and
    VMs.  All running Ubuntu and managed with Puppet.

    My primary UI these days is macOS, primarily on Apple Silicon Mac
    Book Pros.

- Title: Home Automation
  Background: home_automation_bg.jpg
  Description: |
    I started out my home automation adventures with X-10.  The
    biggest problem was that I wanted to control my house with Linux
    and I had trouble finding good options.  For a while I played with
    [MisterHouse](https://github.com/hollie/misterhouse) but
    eventually settled on [Insteon](https://www.insteon.com/) with a
    [Universal Devices](https://www.universal-devices.com/) ISY
    controller, currently an ISY994i.  The ISY devices know a lot
    about Insteon devices and simplify much of the configuration and
    setup.  Control is local (i.e. not via the cloud) but they are
    continually improving and adding additional functionality.

    Most all lights in my house are on the Insteon network.  Most of
    my control functions are basic, turning off lights on timers,
    using motion detection for lights in specific rooms, programming
    one buttons for sequences such as bed time.

    I've recently added Z-Wave thermostats to most of the rooms (there
    is one room that will be hard to wire that I have not gotten to
    yet).  I do some day-night temperature control with those and
    would like to do some occupancy detection to set the heat.

    I wrote a use a Perl interface to the Universal Devices ISY series
    of devices, Device::ISY.  I chose Perl because there were not any
    easily installed SOAP libraries available on Ubuntu when I
    started.  My assignment of the Device::ISY identifier took quite a
    while and I got distracted from the project.  I need to move it
    over to Github where other folks can contribute.  I personally use
    it all the time.

    I currently have a [Home
    Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) installation running on
    a Raspberry Pi 5 powered by PoE with an NVMe disk.  This runs a
    network of dozens of Z-Wave devices, from thermostats to motion
    sensors to switches.  With a significant numbers of automations
    and integrations.

    I'm soon to convert to a Nabu Casa ZWA-2 controller to improve
    reliability.

    I find motion sensors annoying.  I already have one Aquara
    presense sensor installed and a couple more waiting to be
    installed.  I also have a few Apollo automation ESP32 based
    sensors I want to play with.

- Title: IP Telphony
  Background: asterisk_bg.jpg
  Description: |
    I've long been interested in telephony at one point wanting to buy
    a Panasonic Hybrid PBX, but was not willing to spend so much
    money.  Now they are relegated to history.

    Then IP Telephony happened and I learned about Asterisk.  I've
    went through several iterations of ATA adapters and service
    providers.  I finally settled on an Obihai Obi202 with Google
    Voice.  This configuration went stale and I lost intereest.

    In the meantime, I just use Google Voice on whatever device is
    near me.

    Interesttingly, when getting into Ham Radio I found that Allstar
    nodes are based on Asterisk. What goes around comes around.

- Title: PiAware
  Background: piaware_bg.png
  Description: |
    [FlightAware](https://www.flightaware.com/) hosts a community
    network of
    [ADS-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Dependent_Surveillance%E2%80%93Broadcast)
    receivers that track the location of aircraft around the world.
    One option for installing these is to use a Raspberry Pi based
    system called [PiAware](https://www.flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/)
    which uses a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and USB
    Dongle with an external antenna to receive the aircraft location
    information and upload it to the cloud.

    To facilitate a good location for the antenna, I installed a
    Raspberry Pi 3 B+ in a weather-tight box on the outside of my
    house.  Power and networking are via a Power-Over-Ethernet
    connection.  This installation uses a LovePi PoE HAT and a [Flight
    Feeder Pro](https://www.flightaware.com/adsb/prostick/) USB stick.
    Pictures of the installation are available in a [Flickr
    album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jchonig/sets/72157701624465515/).

- Title: Blitzortung
  Background: blitzortung_bg.gif
  Description: |
    The German term Blitzortung means "lightning detection".
    [Blitzortung.org](https://www.blitzortung.org/en/live_lightning_maps.php)
    is a community based installation of ligthning detectors around
    the world.  An installation consists of a receiver and one or both
    of an H-field (magnetic) and E-field (elelctrical) antenna.

    After a few years on a waiting list, I received my kit in
    September of 2018.  Over two years later I assembled it.  The
    boards come mostly pre-assembled, with all the surface mount
    devices (SMD) pre-installed.  All that is required is to solder on
    a few larger components.

    Again, I'm powering this with a POE connection.  I found a PoE to
    USB-A female and am using that to connect to the System BLUE via a
    USB-A to mini-USB connection and a length of sheilded Cat 5.it

    Photos of my installation are available in a [Flickr album](https://flic.kr/s/aHsmToxshR){: .external-link-flickr }.
    My station data is available
    [here](https://www.lightningmaps.org/blitzortung/america/index.php?bo_page=statistics&bo_show=station&bo_sid=2872).

- Title: Docker Containers
  Background: docker_bg.jpg
  Description: |
    As I've migrated my server(s) from Ubuntu 16.04 to Ubuntu 20.04,
    I've put just about all services possible in Docker Containers.
    Someday I plan to write up a bunch of lessons learned.

    I maintain a number of docker containers that you can find on my
    [GitHub](https://github.com/jchonig) site.

- Title: WeatherFlow Tempest Weather System
  Background: weatherflow_bg.jpg
  Description: |
    I've always wanted local weather monitoring.  With the caveat that it not just provide a local display and not only upload the data to a proprietary cloud.

    I think I've found the solution in the [WeatherFlow Tempest
    Weather
    System](https://tempest.earth/tempest-home-weather-system/).
    There seems to be an active community around this product with
    lots of options to obtain and share the data.

    You can see my station data on
    [TempestWX](https://tempestwx.com/station/38406/) or
    [WeatherUnderground](https://www.wunderground.com/dashboard/pws/KNYTRUMA26).
    Pictures of the installation are in a [Flickr album](https://flic.kr/s/aHsmTs8fHh){: .external-link-flickr }.
